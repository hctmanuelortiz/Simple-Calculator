# Simple Calculator

Hi! This is a simple calculator, designed in HTML, CSS and jQuery, it has basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), product (*), division (/) and module (%).

It was made in order to practice these technologies little by little, in the future I will make modifications and add new things.
